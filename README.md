# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (http://localhost:8080/urls).

This is my first project as an student in the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs.
I build an HTTP server that handles requests from the browser(client) and also learned more about Express(web framwork) which is very popular in the Node community and Nodemon pakage which automatically restart your server after changes!
I also learned about git branches and merge all with master at the end and smart cookies and how to secure them with cookie-session Middleware. It's very important to hash passwords with bcrypte and have a safe app!
Special thanks to **LHL** mentors, instructors and cohorts!
